## Abstract

In this analysis I explore the relationship between U.S. Adults preferences for cuisine from different countries to their socioeconomic characteristics, primarily gender. Using student's t-test and linear regression, I conclude that gender, along with education, world cuisine interest, and education, generally play a small but statistically significant role in predicting preferences.

## Introduction {.smaller}

**Our questions**;

::: {.notes}
Anecdote about friend's debate; men like pizza and women like sushi
::: 

- Do men and women have the same preferences in cuisine?
- If so, do any particular countries stand out?
- Do other socioeconomic factors have any affect?

We'd like to understand these factors so we can finally answer question asked time and time again;

## The data

- Our data comes from [FiveThirtyEight's International Food Association's 2014 World Cup](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-fivethirtyeight-international-food-associations-2014-world-cup/) Food World Cup survey conducted in 2014.

- The data has 1,373 responses where participants rate how much they like a given country's food. Other information about the respondents are also available, including gender, world cuisine knowledge, education, age, and income.

- Note that null values were removed for this analysis

## Survey Rating Guidelines {.smaller}

| Value | Description |
|----|----|
| 5 | I love this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's one of the best in the world. |
| 4 | I like this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's considerably above average. |
| 3 | I'm OK with this county's traditional cuisine. I think it's about average. |
| 2 | I dislike this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's considerably below average. |
| 1 | I hate this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's one of the worst in the world. |
| N/A | I'm unfamiliar with this country's traditional cuisine. |

## Distribution of ratings by gender

## Is there a difference? {.smaller}

To see if gender has an effect on rating, we can compare means with a t-test

 - $H_0 | \alpha=0.05$: There is *no* difference in mean rating between genders
 - $H_A | \alpha=0.05$: There is a difference in mean rating between genders

```{.r}
# Calculate observed difference in means    
obs_diff <- long_data |> 
  specify(rating ~ gender) |> 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
    order = c('Male', 'Female'))

# Calculate the null distribution
null_dist <- long_data |> 
  specify(rating ~ gender) |> 
  hypothesise(null = "independence") |>

We can conclude that there is generally a small but statistically significant rating between genders. 

Given our p-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Interaction effect of gender and country {.smaller}

- *Do men and women have the same preferences in cuisine?*

- We answer this question by considering the p-value, or significance, of the interaction effect

- **Interaction Effect**: The incremental effect two independent variables (`gender` & `country`) have on an independent variable (`rating`) when considered collectively

- We can evaluate this using a multiple linear regression with interaction

```{.r}
# Multiple linear regression
gen_country_model <- lm(rating ~ gender * country, data=long_data)
summary(gen_country_model)
```

- While we do find some interesting observations to explore, we should note this model explains a small percentage of the overall variance given our adjusted of $R^2 = 0.13$

```
Residual standard error: 0.8808 on 23229 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.1329,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.1299 
F-statistic: 45.06 on 79 and 23229 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

## Model Observations {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Australia's national dish is roasted lamb
:::

I found two countries where the mean rating differs enough considering gender ($pvalue<\alpha$); China and Australia, which are rated more highly by men.


| term                     | estimate   | std.error  | statistic  | p.value    |
|--------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| genderMale:countryaustralia | 0.3141801 | 0.1541885 | 2.037636   | **0.04159765** |
| genderMale:countrychina     | 0.3298832 | 0.1413940 | 2.333077   | **0.01965260** |


As a country, China recognizes 8 distinct regional cuisine styles, however its food is commonly misrepresented in the United States. I considered this a potential reason for this difference, but did not find any correlation between China's rating and respondents' knowledge of cuisines[^1].

Australia also had no convincing relationships to speak of with other dimensions of the data.

[^1]: Interest in world cuisines was positively correlated with Chinese food rating and could be considered a proxy

## Other factors

- *Education* can play a role; the least educated respondents were more generous in their ratings

- *Income* was similar to education, although a substantial amount of this data was missing

- *Knowledge of world cuisines* unsurprisingly was statistically significant, although a relatively small effect size

- *Interest in world cuisines* had by far the largest coefficient

## Conclusion {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
The linear model always predicted Italy as highest rated food
:::

This analysis is based on observational data which is very likely biased, which limits the generality of these conclusions.

- The wording of the survey responses may have skewed the distribution of ratings

- Socioeconomic factors play a part in people's cuisine preferences, but overall explains very little of the overall rating

- Ratings are slightly different by rating, but we only see two countries where there is a meaningful difference (Australia and China)

- Respondent's interest in cuisine was the best predictor of overall score; if you love food, you love *all* food
