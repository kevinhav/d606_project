## Abstract

In this analysis I explore the relationship between U.S. adults' preferences for cuisine from different countries to their socioeconomic characteristics, primarily gender. Using student's t-test and linear regression, I conclude that gender, along with education, world cuisine interest, and education, generally play a small but statistically significant role in predicting preferences.

## Introduction {.smaller}

**Our questions**;

::: {.notes}
- Anecdote: Significant other likes sushi, I like pizza
- Thought I'd put my new skills to practical use
:::

-   Do men and women have the same preferences in cuisine?
-   Do any particular countries stand out?
-   Do other socioeconomic factors have any affect, and can we use them to predict preferences?

We'd like to understand these factors so we can finally answer the question asked time and time again;

## The data

::: {.notes}
- Independent observations, but observational study - generalizeable but has bias and not causal
- We ignored nulls, including gender, as not clear reason for nulls
:::

-   Our data comes from [FiveThirtyEight's International Food Association's 2014 World Cup](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-fivethirtyeight-international-food-associations-2014-world-cup/) Food World Cup survey conducted in 2014.

-   The data has 1,373 responses where participants rate how much they like a given country's food. Other information about the respondents are also available, including gender, world cuisine knowledge, education, age, and income.

-   Note that null values were removed for this analysis

## Survey Rating Guidelines {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
- Survey questions should be decoupled; should not ask for both preference and "world standing"
- We'll see how this wording affects the results
- Similar ranking and rating for interest and knowledge of food
:::

| Value | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 5 | I love this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's one of the best in the world. |
| 4 | I like this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's considerably above average. |
| 3 | I'm OK with this county's traditional cuisine. I think it's about average. |
| 2 | I dislike this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's considerably below average. |
| 1 | I hate this country's traditional cuisine. I think it's one of the worst in the world. |
| N/A | I'm unfamiliar with this country's traditional cuisine. |

## Distribution of ratings by gender

::: {.notes}
- We can see the skew very clearly here, although the ratings are still approximately normal.
- It looks like women tend to rate food higher on average than men, but we can perform a t-test on the difference between mean ratings to check
:::

## Is there a difference? {.smaller}

:::{.notes}
- We set up our hypothesis as such
- Calculate the observed difference, then the null distribution
- We can see the p-value is near zero for our t-score, so we reject the null hypothesis; there is a meaningful difference between men and women's average ratings
- Up till now we've only looked at average rating by gender, but we want to know if there is a specific country that women prefer, or vice verse
:::

To see if gender has an effect on rating, we can compare means with a t-test

-   $H_0$: There is *no* difference in mean rating between genders
-   $H_A$: There is a difference in mean rating between genders

# Calculate observed difference in means    
obs_diff <- long_data |>

# Calculate the null distribution

  hypothesise(null = "independence") |> 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") |>

    order = c('Male', 'Female'))

# Get p-value

  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff,

We can conclude that there is generally a small but statistically significant rating between genders.

Given our p-value, we reject the null hypothesis.

## Interaction effect of gender and country {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
- To test this, we will set up a multiple linear regression and examine the interaction effect between country and gender as it relates to rating
- This problem could also be framed as ANOVA
- By looking at the interaction effect, we are putting aside the known differences due to gender and country, and examine just the impact of the relationship
:::

-   *Do men and women have the same preferences in cuisine?*

-   We answer this question by considering the p-value of the interaction effect

-   **Interaction Effect**: The incremental effect two independent variables (`gender` & `country`) have on a dependent variable (`rating`) when considered collectively

-   We can evaluate this using a multiple linear regression with interaction

``` r
# Multiple linear regression
gen_country_model <- lm(rating ~ gender * country, data=long_data)
summary(gen_country_model)
```

-   While we do find some interesting observations to explore, we should note this model explains a small percentage of the overall variance given our $R_{adj}^2 = 0.13$

```         
Residual standard error: 0.8808 on 23229 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.1329,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.1299 
F-statistic: 45.06 on 79 and 23229 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

## Model Observations {.smaller}

::: notes
- There are only two countries where the interaction effect had a p-value less than 0.05
- Chinese American food is often confused for authentic Chinese food, so I thought to look at knowledge of cuisines to see if people more familiar with world cuisines were picking up on that distinction.
- I did not see any significance when checking China's ratings against knowledge of cuisines, but I did see some with interest in world cuisines. It is tough to say if this is really a contribution.
Australia's national dish is roasted lamb
:::

I found two countries where the mean rating differs enough considering gender ($pvalue<\alpha$); China and Australia, which are rated more highly by men.

| term                        | estimate  | std.error | statistic | p.value        |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| genderMale:countryaustralia | 0.3141801 | 0.1541885 | 2.037636  | **0.04159765** |
| genderMale:countrychina     | 0.3298832 | 0.1413940 | 2.333077  | **0.01965260** |

As a country, China recognizes 8 distinct regional cuisine styles, however its food is commonly misrepresented in the United States. I considered this a potential reason for this difference, but did not find any correlation between China's rating and respondents' knowledge of cuisines[^1].

[^1]: Interest in world cuisines was positively correlated with Chinese food rating and could be considered a proxy

Australia also had no convincing relationships to speak of with other dimensions of the data.

## Other factors

-   *Education* can play a role; the least educated respondents were more generous in their ratings

-   *Income* was similar to education, although a substantial amount of this data was missing

-   *Knowledge of world cuisines* unsurprisingly was statistically significant, although a relatively small effect size

-   *Interest in world cuisines* had by far the largest coefficient

## Conclusion {.smaller}

::: notes
The linear model always predicted Italy as highest rated food
:::

This analysis is based on observational data which is very likely biased, which limits the generality of these conclusions.

-   The wording of the survey responses may have skewed the distribution of ratings

-   Socioeconomic factors play a part in people's cuisine preferences, but overall explains very little of the overall rating

-   Ratings are slightly different by rating, but we only see two countries where there is a meaningful difference (Australia and China)

-   Respondent's interest in cuisine was the best predictor of overall score; if you love food, you love *all* food
